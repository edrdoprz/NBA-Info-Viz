NBA-Info-Viz
============

CS 4460 Info Vizualization Project.  We see each NBA Final 8 Teams' Big 3 players' stats.

To view the final product, download the zip, extract, and open up the file 'NBAKidzViz.html'. The circles can be clicked on and information will appear when you hover over some circles. On the last level, when you click on a player's circle, his stats appear in one of the boxes on the lower right. Click on another player to put his stats in the other box and compare stats.
